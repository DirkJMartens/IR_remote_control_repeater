- Started with bare ATMega328P-PU (no bootloader in the chip yet) 
- Download files for bootloader to use 8MHz internal RC oscillator (i.e. not using external xtal) 
- use Arduino Uno to download bootloader 
- once bootloader was installed in ATMega, remove AVR chip from Uno board and connect ATMega chip with Uno board using Rx/Tx lines

/* Changes from original software code 
 * - void loop(): changed delay(1000) to delay(100)
 * - commented out all Serial.print statements 
 * - void loop(): commented out if (serial.read) 
 * - added GotOne = false after enableIRIn 
 * - added My_Receiver.blink13(true);
 */

/* Initial hardware setup:
 * - Needs a ATMega328 (ATMega168 is too small, 14kB program, 1.2K sram)
 * - IR receiver (e.g. 3-pin outputting raw signal, not modulated carrier): GND / 5V / data=D11 (atmega pin 17) 
 * - IR send (=IR diode): GND / D3 (atmega pin 5) 
 * - green led: GND / D13 (atmega pin 19) 
 * - 16 Mhz xtal pins 9/10 (with 2 x 22pF caps to Gnd)
 * - pin 1 (reset) with 10K resistor to Vcc
 * - pins 7 / 20 : Vcc
 * - pins 8 / 22 : Gnd
 * - 2 x 0.1uF decoupling capacitors across pins 7/8 and 20/22 of the ATMega328
 */

/* Programming the ATMega328: 
 * - Used instructions to re-configure to "breadboard AVR": 
 *    - Google "From Arduino to a Microcontroller on a Breadboard" 
 *    - Go to section "Minimal circuit (Eliminating external clock) 
 *    - Download "breadboard-1-6-x.zip" which will add an entry in "Board" section 
 *    - Unzip into a folder "hardware" which you need to create in your Arduino folder 
 *    - Download "ArduinoISP" into the Arduino Uno board which you will use as an ICSP programmer
 *    - Connect ATMega to Uno using 4 wires (MOSI-MISO-SCK-Reset) as well as GND/VCC. 
 *    - If ATMega was programmed/used before with external XTAL, bootloading needs a Xtal 
 *    - Once bootloader was loaded and configured as "internal clock", you can remove the Xtal 
 *    - ATMega now has bootloader and doesnt require Xtal. 
 *    - Downloading new sketch can be done using Rx/Tx pins on the ATMega 
 *    - If using laptop with USB port, a USB-to-RS232 adapter is needed. E.g. Arduino with CPU removed. 
 *    - If using laptop with DB9-serial port, a simple level-changer +-12v to 0/5V is enough (e.g. MAX232 chip).
